This repository is simply a scratchpad of my solutions to the [AdventOfCode.com](https://adventofcode.com/) programming challenges. I'm not actually trying to do them on a schedule. They're just fun to use as a way to pick up or practice coding in various languages, mostly for when I'm bored or otherwise unoccupied.
